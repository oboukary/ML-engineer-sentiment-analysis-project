# ML-engineer-sentiment-analysis-project

### Udacity machine learning engineer nanodegree 

This project is part of the Udacity machine learning engineer nanodegree .
In this project I used SageMaker to build a model a reccurent neural network in order to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews.
The notebook and Python files provided here, once completed, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews.
